Enter a usernameâ€”the part of the email address that comes before @outlook.com.
Select the dropdown arrow at the far right of the username field to change the domain from the default outlook.com to hotmail.com if you prefer a Hotmail address. Then select Next.
Enter a password, then select Next.
Enter your first and last name in the fields provided, then select Next.
Choose your Country/region, enter your Birthdate, then select Next.
Enter the characters from the CAPTCHA image, then select Next.
Outlook will set up your account and display a welcome screen.
You can now open your new Outlook.com account on the web or set it up for access in email programs on computers and mobile devices.
